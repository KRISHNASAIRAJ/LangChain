# Introduction

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

It provides a standard interface for accessing language models, along with a collection of chains for common language applications.

Developers can use LangChain to build applications that use language models to interact with data, solve problems, or generate text.

It supports Productionization where we will be using LangSmith to deploy the applications.

LangChain implements a standard interface for large language models and related technologies, such as embedding models and vector stores, and integrates with hundreds of providers.
